# Overview 

This repo represents uniform structure that describes software/hardware configuration files based
on nix package manager, flakes and home-manager. 
It unlocks ability to reproduce my personalized setup on any linux/darwin based host without any time-consuming hassle.

> [!WARNING]
> WIP. Darwin host configuration is not yet ready.

## Motivation

Setting up your favorite environment on new machine is a time-consuming task,
furthermore if you want to keep them all in sync between machines then it's even more time-consuming,
eventually I got tired of configuring and installing everything again until I found NixOS, and it's declarative ecosystem.
It's a big pleasure to be able to define the whole system configuration
such as hardware and software in just one repo.

## Software

List of software that I prefer in my daily life and work workflows, I prefer to use software
written in languages that understand, so I can explore those solutions and contribute if needed.
Also, I'm huge fan of rust written apps I and believe there is no better alternative right now.

## Hardware

I do have a dell laptop with nixos and macbook pro with macos, so this config supports both linux and darwin targets.

# Prerequisites

## [nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

## [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin)

```shell
sudo nix run nix-darwin/master#darwin-rebuild -- switch
```

## experimental features enabled

* nix-command
* flakes
* pipe-operators

# Getting Started

## Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:nanobreaker/nix-config.git ~/.config/nix-config
```

## Check
```shell
nix flake check
```

## Build

#### Linux 
```shell
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos
```

### Darwin
```shell
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#darwin
```

## Keybinds

Here I will list my keybinds across all the programs, so I can easily look them up later
and perform some analysis on how create non-intersecting layouts for different programs.
